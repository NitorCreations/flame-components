Nitor Design System for nitoreans by nitoreans.

# Getting started
## How to clone the repo
0. [Add an SSH key to Github](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/)
1. Press the green button near the top-right corner, and copy the address (looks like git@github.com:..)
2. Open Terminal or another command line client, and navigate to the folder that contains your projects (eg. `cd ~/code`)
3. type `git clone <paste the url here> flame`. This will create a folder called "flame", and clone this repo there

## Development
0. First, make sure to [have yarn installed](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/). You'll also want a good code editor.
1. Go to your flame folder, and type `yarn`. This will install all dependencies
2. To run the storybook, type `yarn run storybook`.
3. An easy way to get started is to combine these two commands: `yarn; yarn run storybook`
